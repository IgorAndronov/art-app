ABOUT
Story Behind the Art
I am largely a self-taught artist with my best teacher being the great outdoors. My sincere wish to become a painter was always blocked by real life commitments but the desire never left me. With the required time now available I am pursuing this ambition, ultimately painting in oils this universe. I’m originally from Ukraine living in Germany. Hope, soon I’ll be back home. Glory to Ukraine!
I am an exuberant artist and paint in my own fashion as broadly as my mood allows with spirit and fantasy sense. My favorite color is white and I love when there are a lot of cream oils on my canvas what allows me to create an unusual texture, relief and line by sculpting oil paint with my palette knife.
My work always tries to demonstrate the inspiring connection and response to my real  surroundings. I strive to create paintings which celebrate life and excite the soul. My aim is for people to feel good and peaceful when looking at my creations.
I hope that my work transports you to another place and time.
Enjoy what is created when my palette knife applies paint to canvas!
